# Ensemble-Statistical-Modeling-for-False-Info-Recognition

Multiple machine learning algorithms, ranging from Random Forests to Support Vector Machines, are employed as individual models in the ensemble. The models are trained, validated, and optimized to ensure their performance is at its peak. The ensemble model is constructed by combining predictions from these diverse models, employing techniques like Bagging or Boosting to leverage their varied strengths and produce more accurate overall predictions. 
This project aims to improve the accuracy of predicting fake news by developing an optimized ensemble model using stacking and model averaging techniques.
